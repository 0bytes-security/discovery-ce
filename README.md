## Backstory

Discovery was born out of a need for a more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly approach to security assessments. Traditional methods often involve manual configuration, juggling different tools, and waiting for assessments to complete. We envisioned a platform that would:

- **Automate tedious tasks:**  Free up security professionals to focus on more critical activities.
- **Centralize tool management:** Make it easy to integrate and use a wide range of tools. 
- **Provide instant visibility:**  Enable real-time monitoring and analysis for faster response.
- **Empower collaboration:** Encourage community involvement and contributions to improve and expand the platform.
