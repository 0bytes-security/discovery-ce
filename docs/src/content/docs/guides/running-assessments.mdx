This guide explains how to initiate and manage security assessments using Discovery.

## Task Registration

Before you can run assessments, you need to register the tasks (security tools) you want to use. Refer to the [**Task Integration**](/guides/task-integration) guide for details on defining and registering tasks using the schema-based approach. 

## Accessing the User Interface

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the address where your Discovery frontend is running (usually `http://localhost:3000` for development).
2. Log in to the platform.

## Exploring the UI

Familiarize yourself with the Discovery user interface:

- **Tasks:** You should have a section for viewing and managing registered tasks. 
- **Assessments:**  This section allows you to create new assessments and view the results of previous assessments.
- **Workflows (Optional):** If you have implemented workflow functionality, there might be a section for creating, managing, and running workflows.

## Initiating an Assessment

1. **Create a New Assessment:**  In the assessments section, click on "Create New Assessment" (or a similar button).
2. **Select a Task:**  Choose the task you want to execute from the list of registered tasks. The UI should display the task's name and description. 
3. **Configure Parameters:**  Enter the required parameters for the selected task. The UI should guide you with input fields based on the task's defined schema.  
4. **(Optional) Set Variables:**  If your task is part of a workflow that uses variables, provide the values for these variables. 
5. **Start the Assessment:** Click the "Start" or "Run" button to initiate the assessment. 

## Monitoring Progress

- **Real-time Updates:**  The UI should display real-time updates about the assessment's progress, including:
    - Task status (pending, running, completed, failed).
    - Progress indicators.
    - Any output or findings from the tool in real-time (if the tool provides it).
- **Notifications:** Discovery may use WebSockets and/or Pusher to send real-time updates and notifications.

## Viewing Results

- **Assessment Details:**  Once the assessment is complete, the UI will typically provide a detailed view of the assessment run. 
- **Results Data:**  The UI will display the results from the security tool. The format of the results will depend on the tool used. 
- **Files:** If the assessment generated files (e.g., reports, log files), you should be able to download them from the UI.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Messages:**  If an error occurs during the assessment, the UI should display an error message. Check the error message for clues about the problem.
- **Logs:** Review the logs for the backend API and Celery workers to get more detailed information about the error. 
- **GitHub Discussions:**  If you're unable to resolve the error, search for similar issues on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/0bytes-security/discovery-ce/discussions) or create a new discussion describing the problem.
