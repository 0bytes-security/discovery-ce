Welcome to Discovery!  This guide walks you through the steps for setting up the platform and running your first security assessment. 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker:**  [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)
- **Python 3.12:** [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) 
- **Poetry (Python Package Manager):** [https://python-poetry.org/](https://python-poetry.org/)
- **Node.js:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Nx (Monorepo Management):** [https://nx.dev/](https://nx.dev/)
- **PostgreSQL:**  [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
- **AWS Account:** (Optional - only if you want to use Amazon S3 for storage).
- **Clerk Account:**  [https://clerk.com/](https://clerk.com/) (For user authentication).


1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0bytes-security/discovery-ce.git
    cd discovery-ce
    ```

2. Install Dependencies

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the Backend Directory

    ```bash
    cd apps/frontend
    ```

2. Install Backend Dependencies

    ```bash
    cd apps/api && poetry install 
    ```

3. Configure Environment Variables (`.env`)

    In the `apps/api` directory, create a `.env` file based on the example provided in [`docker/api/.env.dev`](https://github.com/0bytes-security/discovery-ce/blob/main/docker/api/.env.dev). Configure the following essential environment variables:

    ```env
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"  # Replace with your database details 

    # Docker 
    DOCKER_HOST="unix:///var/run/docker.sock" # Or your Docker host address if different
    DOCKER_ALLOWED_IMAGES="projectdiscovery/subfinder:latest,projectdiscovery/httpx:latest,..." # Add other allowed images 
    DOCKER_VOLUMES_PATH="/path/to/your/volumes" # Directory for storing container volumes 

    # (Optional)  Amazon S3 Configuration (for storage)
    AWS_S3_ENDPOINT="..." # Your S3 endpoint (e.g., for MinIO, use the MinIO server address)
    AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..." # Your S3 access key ID
    AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..." # Your S3 secret access key
    AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME="discovery-ce-bucket"  # Your S3 bucket name 

    # (Optional) Pusher Configuration (for real-time notifications)
    PUSHER_APP_ID="..." # Your Pusher app ID
    PUSHER_KEY="..." # Your Pusher key
    PUSHER_SECRET="..." # Your Pusher secret
    PUSHER_CLUSTER="..." # Your Pusher cluster

    ```

    **Notes:**
    - **Docker Allowed Images:** In `DOCKER_ALLOWED_IMAGES`, you need to specify the Docker images for all the security tools you want to integrate. Discovery enforces restrictions on allowed images for security.  
    - **Amazon S3:**  You only need to configure S3 settings if you want to use S3 for storing assessment results and logs.
    - **Pusher:** Only configure Pusher if you intend to use it for real-time notifications in addition to WebSockets.


4. Run the Backend Development Server

    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn discovery.app:app --reload
    ```

    Now, your backend API server should be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

    ```bash
    cd apps/frontend
    ```
2. Set your environment variables

    In the `apps/frontend` directory, create a `.env.local` Configure the following essential environment variables:

    ```env
    # Clerk Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
    # Keep these in .env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/signin
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/signup
    ```

3. Run the Frontend Development Server

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Now, your backend API server should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. Running Your First Assessment 

    1. **Login/Register:** Access yourDiscovery frontend application in your web browser and create an account using Clerk.
    2. **Explore the Interface:** Familiarize yourself with the UI.  You'll usually find sections to manage tasks, create assessments, choose tools, configure parameters, and view results.
    3. **Register a Task:** Use the `POST /tasks` API endpoint (or the UI if implemented) to upload a task schema in JSON or YAML format.
    4. **Create Assessment:** Define your first assessment, specifying the target domain or IP, selecting the registered task, and providing any necessary parameters.
    5. **Run and Monitor:** Initiate the assessment.  You should see real-time updates about the assessment progress on your screen, delivered via WebSockets.
    6. **View Results:** After the assessment completes, you can access and analyze the results through the frontend UI.

    **Notes:**
    - The frontend is under development, only authentication is ready with profile edit.
